# Do I Cram?



**_Take control of your grades without the stress._**

"Do I Cram?" is a comprehensive Android application designed to help students track their academic performance, calculate their grades, and determine their standing in a course without relying on a professor's official grade release. The app provides a detailed, customizable grading system that puts you in the driver's seat of your academic journey.

## ✨ Features

* **Target Grade Setting:** Set a target grade for each course and monitor your progress toward it directly from the dashboard.
* **Quick Grade Calculator:** Use the built-in, non-persistent calculator to quickly determine your grade for a single course or to calculate your Cumulative GPA (CGPA) without saving the data to your profile.
